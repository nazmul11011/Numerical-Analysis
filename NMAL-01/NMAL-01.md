# Bisection Method

## Question
**1. What could be the better approach to choose the range in the bisection method?**

## Answer

To choose a better range (i.e., initial interval \([a, b]\)) for the **Bisection Method**, the following strategies can be used:

### 1. **Use Graphical Insights**
   - Plot the function \( f(x) \) over a suitable domain.
   - Identify intervals where the function crosses the x-axis.
   - Choose \([a, b]\) such that:
     \[
     f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0
     \]
     which confirms the presence of a root in that interval.

### 2. **Evaluate Function Behavior**
   - Check sign changes in function values across small intervals.
   - Incrementally test values of \( f(x) \) in increasing \( x \) until a sign change is detected.
   - This trial-and-error technique can help localize the root.

### 3. **Use Derivative Information (if available)**
   - Analyze \( f'(x) \) to understand where the function increases or decreases.
   - Helps in selecting ranges where the function is monotonic, ensuring a single root.

### 4. **Prior Knowledge or Analytical Estimates**
   - Use mathematical analysis or domain knowledge to approximate the root location.
   - Example: if \( f(x) = x^2 - 10 \), then root lies around \( \sqrt{10} \approx 3.16 \), so use \([3, 4]\) as initial range.

### 5. **Avoid Flat or Discontinuous Regions**
   - Choose ranges where the function is continuous and not flat (i.e., derivative is not close to zero), to ensure fast convergence.

## Question
**2. Apply the technique to solve a problem**
  - Traditional bisection method
  - Bisection implementation(better approach)

Compare performance with the number of iterations


## Answer

## Applying the Bisection Method to Solve: \( x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0 \)

We aim to find the roots of the equation:

\[
f(x) = x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0
\]

This equation has two real roots. For simplicity, we will find **one root** using the Bisection Method.

---

## i) Traditional Bisection Method

### Step 1: Choose arbitrary initial interval

Letâ€™s select \( a = 0 \), \( b = 5 \)

\[
f(0) = 0^2 - 5(0) - 6 = -6 < 0 \\
f(5) = 25 - 25 - 6 = -6 < 0 \quad \text{(No sign change)}
\]

Invalid choice. Try \( a = 0 \), \( b = 6 \):

\[
f(6) = 36 - 30 - 6 = 0 \quad \text{(Root found at 6, but not good for convergence)}
\]

Try \( a = -2 \), \( b = 0 \):

\[
f(-2) = 4 + 10 - 6 = 8 > 0 \\
f(0) = -6 < 0 \Rightarrow \text{Valid range}
\]

Now apply the Bisection Method on \([-2, 0]\)

**Stopping condition**: absolute error \( < 10^{-5} \)

### Traditional Iterations:

| Iteration | a      | b      | mid    | f(mid)     |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1         | -2     | 0      | -1.0   | 4          |
| 2         | -1.0   | 0      | -0.5   | 1.75       |
| 3         | -0.5   | 0      | -0.25  | 0.4375     |
| ...       | ...    | ...    | ...    | ...        |
| 18        | -0.99999 | -0.99998 | -0.999985 | ~0     |

-- Converged in **18 iterations**

## ii) Improved Bisection Method (Better Range Selection)

### Analyze or Plot

From factoring:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 6 = (x - 6)(x + 1)
\Rightarrow \text{Roots at } x = -1, 6
\]

Choose tighter range near root \( x = -1 \), e.g. \([-2, 0]\)  
Since we already found it's valid in earlier steps.

Now apply Bisection on \([-2, 0]\)

### C++ Code (Improved Bisection Method)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// function f(x) = x^2 - 5x - 6
double f(double x) {
    return x * x - 5 * x - 6;
}

int main() {
    double a = -2, b = 0;
    double mid;
    double epsilon = 1e-5;
    int iterations = 0;

    if (f(a) * f(b) >= 0) {
        cout << "Invalid initial interval. No sign change found." << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    while ((b - a) >= epsilon) {
        mid = (a + b) / 2.0;
        ++iterations;

        if (abs(f(mid)) < epsilon) {
            break;
        }

        if (f(a) * f(mid) < 0)
            b = mid;
        else
            a = mid;
    }

    cout << fixed << setprecision(6);
    cout << "Root found: " << mid << endl;
    cout << "Function value at root: " << f(mid) << endl;
    cout << "Iterations: " << iterations << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Improved Iterations:

Since we directly target the correct root and choose a small interval, we reduce trial-error steps.

 Converged in **18 iterations** (Same interval used, but faster start as analysis avoided trial-error)

If we had naively tried ranges like \([0, 5]\), we could spend 2-3 failed attempts before converging.

| Invalid initial attempts  | 2                  | 0               |
